# Effeminare-s-Quest---RPG-built-with-Unity
Effeminareâ€™s Quest is a 2D RPG built in Unity that explores queer identity through time travel. Players journey between the 1960s and 2024 using ruby shoes, uncovering moments from the Stonewall Riots to present-day queer rights. A playful and powerful celebration of queer history.
